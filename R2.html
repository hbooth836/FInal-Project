		<h1>Tips</h1>

		<ul>

		<h3><li>Reduce the amount of unwanted mail you receive. The average resident in America receives over 30 pounds of junk mail per year.</h3></li>

		<h3><li>Buy products with little or no packaging.</h3></li>

		<h3><li>Start using reusable products such as a reusable water bottle, a couple grocery totes, a few cloth bags and reusable jars and bottles.</h3></li>

		<h3><li>Use refillable pens, piston fountain pens, mechanical pencils, refillable white board markers and donate extra office material (paper, pencils) to your public school's art program.</h3></li>

		<h3><li>Buy items made of recycled content, and use and reuse them as much as you can. For instance, use both sides of every page of a notebook before moving on to the next clean notebook.  Use unneeded, printed on printer paper for a scratch pad.</h3></li></li>

		<h1>Facts</h1>

		<ul>
		
		<h3><li>Enough energy is saved by recycling one aluminum can to run a TV set for three hours or to light one 100 watt bulb for 20 hours.</h3></li>

		<h3><li>During the time it takes you to read this sentence, 50,000 12-ounce aluminum cans are made.</h3></li>
		
		<h3><li>A 60-watt light bulb can be run for over a day on the amount of energy saved by recycling 1 pound of steel. In one year in the United States, the recycling of steel saves enough energy to heat and light 18,000,000 homes!</h3></li>

		<h3><li>The highest point in Hamilton County, Ohio (near Cincinnati) is "Mount Rumpke." It is actually a mountain of trash at the Rumpke sanitary landfill towering 1045 ft. above sea level.</h3></li>

		<h3><li>An estimated 80,000,000 Hershey's Kisses are wrapped each day, using enough aluminum foil to cover over 50 acres of space -- that's almost 40 football fields. All that foil is recyclable, but not many people realize it.</h3></li>
